            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h3>Hi! I am Lira</h3>
            <p>I love to cook food. In fact, for most of my life, cooking usually means microwaving iced food or adding
                boiling water to something that comes out of a box. It wasn’t until I got married that I started eating
                real food because I married someone who cooks. I started joining the kitchen with him and realized that
                cooking can be fun. Eating real food was really fun. And gain confidence as a home chef? Life changed!

        <p>I believe you can make great food with everyday ingredients even<br> if you’re short on time and cost
            conscious. You just need to cook clever and get creative!</p>

                <h2>Pakora (Indian Vegetable Fitters)</h2>
                <p>To make vegetable fritters irresistible … make Pakora!! These are Indian vegetable patties, spiced
                    and fried until golden and crispy. They can be made with virtually any vegetable, so use this pakora
                    recipe as a springboard to do your own variations.</p>

                <h2>Palak Paneer</h2>
                <p>Palak Paneer is the ultimate and best-known Indian spinach curry, made with golden pan-fried pieces
                    of cheese (paneer). For a recipe this special, I can’t endorse shortcuts. This version is made
                    entirely from scratch – including the paneer cheese!</p>
